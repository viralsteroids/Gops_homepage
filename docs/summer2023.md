How long have the founders known one another and how did you meet? Have any of the founders not met in person?
We both attended Novosibirsk State University and started to communicate more frequently several years ago, as our mutual interest in natural language processing emerged.
Who writes code, or does other technical work on your product? Was any of it done by a non-founder? Please explain.
Alexander Abolmasov developed the initial prototype code. Subsequently, Alex shifted his focus to sales, marketing, and product development. Meanwhile, Yury began expanding the product's capabilities. As our operations grew, we started hiring engineers to join our team. At present, we have a team of 11 engineers, with Yury overseeing the overall architecture, supervising, and reviewing the work of the other engineers.

Progress
How far along are you?
Our enterprise-grade product is currently utilized in production environments by numerous prominent corporations.

Our proprietary technology modules include:

1. OCR (optical character recognition) that can be installed on-premises, matching ABBYY FineReader in quality and speed, with additional advanced document-related features, such as signatures, stamps, barcodes, and handwritten text.
2. AI models capable of being trained on 4-6 examples using a CPU to accurately extract attributes from documents.
3. Advanced UI for incorporating human-in-the-loop functionality to markup and verify documents.
4. Recently added support for GPT models (GPT-3.5 and open-source models), allowing users to initiate data extraction from documents using LLM prompts and transition to our ML model for more consistent and high-quality results. Users can interact with individual documents or entire document sets.
If you track metrics around user engagement and retention, what are they?
At present, we experience a negative churn rate as our enterprise clients typically begin with 1-2 document processing cases. Within 6-9 months, customers often express the desire to expand their usage by 2-3 times. We see the potential for a 30x increase in some clients, escalating from $50K to $1.5m per client. Our average churn rate stands at -21%, while our retention rate is 92%.



How do users find your product? How did you get the users you have now? If you run paid ads, what is your cost of acquisition?
Our primary sales channel is high-touch direct sales, which has proven effective in reaching our target audience. In order to further expand our sales and increase market penetration, we plan to implement the following strategies:

1. Introduce a freemium, bottom-up product called DocuTable, designed to cater to the mass market and attract a wider range of potential customers.
2. Capitalize on the strong demand from technology partners, such as IT advisors, integrators, and value-added resellers (VARs), who can help promote and distribute our products.
3. Leverage Robotic Process Automation (RPA) channels to integrate our solutions with existing automation tools, further enhancing our product offerings and increasing our market reach.
How long have each of you been working on this? How much of that has been full-time? Please explain.
We initiated customer development in February 2019 and completed our first prototype by August 2019. After conducting pilot tests in the fall of 2019, we brought on our first employee, a front-end developer, in May 2020. At that point, our founders shifted to working full-time on the project. We made our first sale in June 2020 and launched the initial minimum viable product (MVP) in December 2020. Since then, we have concentrated on enhancing our product, financing these improvements through revenue generated from our enterprise clients.
Are people using your product?
Yes
How many active users or customers do you have? How many are paying? Who is paying you the most, and how much do they pay you?
We successfully bootstrapped our company, achieving a $1.5m ARR. Initially focusing on enterprise customers, including around 50 enterprise-level paying customers such as leading insurance and retail companies, 5 of the top 10 banks, 3 of the top 10 construction firms, and other renowned industry leaders like Mars, PepsiCo, and Dolce & Gabbana. Furthermore, we cater to approximately 100 small and medium-sized business (SMB) clients, a segment that is experiencing rapid growth after the introduction of AutoGPT features.
On average, enterprise customers contribute $50K per year, while our top 10 clients generate between $100K and $200K annually. Meanwhile, SMB clients typically contribute around $500 to $1K per year.
Do you have revenue?
yes
Where does your revenue come from? If your revenue comes from multiple sources (e.g., multiple products, multiple companies or a mix of consulting and this product), please break down how much is coming from each source.
Our revenue breakdown consists of 80% from software licenses and 20% from services, such as setup and support.
Anything else you would like us to know regarding your revenue or growth rate?
We employ a consumption-based pricing model, charging clients on a per-page basis. This approach aligns our interests with those of our clients, ensuring that our success is directly tied to their satisfaction with our services. Additionally, this pricing model simplifies the decision-making process for clients, as it allows them to easily assess the cost and value of our services, leading to faster and more confident choices.
If you are applying with the same idea as a previous batch, did anything change? If you applied with a different idea, why did you pivot and what did you learn from the last idea?
GPT models play a crucial role in bridging the gap during the final stage of document model training. They facilitate the initial markup, eliminating the need for the customary 1-2 week setup and training period typically required for enterprise documents. Small and medium-sized business (SMB) users often lack the time and resources to wait for this process to be completed.

With the help of GPT models, users can now commence work immediately and later transition to more stable and higher-quality models. These specialized models focus on extracting specific attributes and are trained based on both the input from GPT models and human-in-the-loop verifications. This approach provides a more streamlined experience for users, particularly those in the SMB sector, by reducing the time and financial investment required to implement document processing solutions.

Who are your competitors? What do you understand about your business that they don't?
Our primary competitors include Instabase, Eigen Technologies, ABBYY, Smart Engines, and Google Vision. Additionally, there are template-based document processing companies and those that incorporate human-in-the-loop solutions, such as Dbrain. Potential future competitors could emerge as the market continues to evolve.

Among these competitors, Instabase is our closest rival, having emerged from stealth mode in October 2019 and quickly becoming a unicorn. However, our focus on a no-code approach, complete document pipeline management, and superior handling of tables and complex documents sets us apart. While users utilize ABBYY, Smart Engines, and Google Vision, these products are limited to extracting information from a fixed and narrow range of document types.

Template-based solutions have their drawbacks, and users are often dissatisfied with their limitations. Companies like Dbrain that incorporate human-in-the-loop approaches may raise concerns among clients who are reluctant to share their documents with external personnel.

We are confident in our growth potential, given the 60%+ market CAGR. We believe there is ample room for both companies to expand, and we are optimistic about outperforming Instabase in head-to-head competition by offering a superior product.

It is important to note that we do not compete with Robotic Process Automation (RPA) solutions. Instead, our product complements RPA offerings by enabling users to handle a broader range of document types and address more complex challenges. Instabase, on the other hand, provides a platform more akin to a raw framework rather than a product tailored to non-technical users. Their focus is on assisting IT developers in building their pipelines.
In comparison to our competitors, we have a deeper understanding of our business in several key aspects:

- We have a clear vision for creating an exceptional product that addresses customer pain points.
- Our emphasis lies in seamless integration with existing IT systems.
- We provide a unified platform catering to both enterprises and SMEs.
- Our solutions handle semi-structured input and generate structured output.
- We possess multilingual expertise.

As for what sets our product apart, we offer:

1. A fast and user-friendly self-service platform
2. Comprehensive document cycle management
3. Complete digitalization of document processes
4. A no-code approach similar to Excel, with the option to write code if desired

Regarding the "rocket science" aspect of our business, we have successfully built a high-performing system with numerous complex elements working in harmony. This requires meticulous attention to detail and coordination, ensuring that every component functions optimally, just like in rocket science.
